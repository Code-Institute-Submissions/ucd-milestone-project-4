# User Centric Design Milestone Project
For my UCD Milestone Project, I am creating a website for 60's band The Monkees.  I will target their fan base 
by using images and colours reminiscent of their hayday.  I will showcase their music via audio 
and video clips and provide ways for fans to stay in touch with the latest band news.

## UX
The primary targets of this website are current and potential fans of The Monkees. 

1. A current fan wants to hear new material, listen to the classics, see video footage of performances and keep up to date with the latest news.
2. A potential fan would like to see what The Monkees have to offer today's music scene. Who are they?
3. For the owners of the site, they want to showcase their music, keep their fans up to date with new music & touring, and display photos, audio & video clips.
4. A booking agent for corporate events wants to see that the band are currently performing live and have a way to contact them for potential bookings.
5. Music Publishers and Project Supervisors might be looking for a song for a movie or TV programme and would like to hear samples of music.

Working with "mobile-first" in mind, I decided to go with the format discribed in the "Resume Lesson" where the logo is on top, followed by a picture of the band, followed by a colourful menu for four pages. 
I used the colours from the cover of the band's "Best Of" album, red, yellow, green and pink along with a funky font for the headings to create an authentic 60's display.

I split the Home Page into two sections: Latest Release section to display the bands most up to date musical release and the Latest News section for the user to see the latest news headings about the band.

In the footer, I put a list of upcoming tour dates, a newsletter for the user to sign up to, and social media links for the user to follow the band on these platforms. So, in the header and footer on every page, a picture of the band is displayed, notification of upcoming gigs are shown and the user has a variety of ways to stay in touch with current happenings of the band.

The Music Page shows four album/single covers and provides a way for the user to listen to the band's music. This showcases the band's music by allowing the user to listen to audio tracks and the text gives an insight into each one.

The Band Page has a picture of each band member along with an image of the instrument they played in the band, followed by a brief bio on each member. This should satisfy the band as they requested pictures be shown of them. The user fan would also be interested in seeing the band member pictures along with a short bio.

The Book Us Page shows a picture of the cover of an album and plays a video of the band after clicking the button. For potential bookings, a booking form is available for the user to enter their details and enquire about potential dates. Above the booking form, a statement saying that the band are available for Christmas parties and Weddings should also satisfy the request of the band.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Menu Items: If the user clicks on any of the menu items they will be taken to that page.
- Read More Buttons: By clicking on these, the user is brought to a new page to read all about the corresponding news heading.
- Newsletter Sign Up: In the footer, I put an input box for the user to put their email address and a submit button to sign up to the bands newsletter. After signing up, a pop-up reassures the user.
- Social Media Icons: Once clicked, the user will be brought to the associated Social Media Page.
- Audio Display: On the "Home" page and the "Music" page, under the pictures of the band are "Click to listen" buttons where the user can listen to music. A new page will open playing the song on an audio player.

### Features Left to Implement
- more live videos.
- live feed.
- add a store for merchandise.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com): For the Grid System and buttons across the site.
- Hover(cdnjs): I used "sweep to bottom" hover on the menu items.  When the user hovers over a menu item, a transparent shade sweeps down over the selection to highlight what the user is about to select.  Also used on Social Media icons in the Footer.
- Google Fonts: I used "Spicy Rice" font on the menu headings and page headings to create a fun 60's vibe.  I used "Exo" font (with sans-serif backup) on everything else for easy reading.
- Font Awesome(fontawesome.com): For Social Media icons in the footer.

## Testing
- Page Navigation: Page menu across all pages.  The Monkees logo on top also brings the user to the Home page. All working and complete.
- Social Media icons: Clicking on each will bring the user to the associated Social Media Pages. All working and complete.
- Audio Clips: When "Click to listen" button is clicked, a new page opens with audio player playing the music clip. (used target="_blank") All working and complete.
- Video Clips: Click on a button to play a video of the band playing "Daydream Believer".  Can pause it by clicking on the video screen. All working and complete.
- Booking Form: On "Book Us" page and has input boxes for name, email and enquiry text. Pop-up reassurance. All working and complete.
