# User Centric Design Milestone Project
For my UCD Milestone Project, I am creating a website for 60's band The Monkees.  I will target their fan base 
by using images and colours reminiscent of their hayday.  I will showcase their music via audio 
and video clips and provide ways for fans to stay in touch with the latest band news.

## UX
The primary target of this website are current and potential fans of The Monkees.  
1. A current fan wants to hear new material, listen to the classics and see video footage of performances
2. A potential fan would like to see what The Monkees have to offer today's music scene.
3. A booking agent for corporate events wants to see that the band are currently performing live and have a way to contact them for potential bookings.
4. Music Publishers and Project Supervisors might be looking for a song for a movie or TV programme and would like to hear samples of music.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Newsletter Sign Up: In the footer, I put an input box for the user to put their email address and a submit button to sign up to the bands newsletter.
- Audio Display: On the "Home" page and the "Music" page, under the pictures of the band are "Click to listen" buttons where the user can listen to music.
