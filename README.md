# User Centric Design Milestone Project
For my UCD Milestone Project, I am creating a website for 60's band The Monkees.  I will target their fan base 
by using images and colours reminiscent of their hayday.  I will showcase their music via audio 
and video clips and provide ways for fans to stay in touch with the latest band news.

## UX
The primary targets of this website are current and potential fans of The Monkees. 

1. A current fan wants to hear new material, listen to the classics, see video footage of performances and keep up to date with the latest news.
2. A potential fan would like to see what The Monkees have to offer today's music scene. Who are they?
3. For the owners of the site, they want to showcase their music, keep their fans up to date with new music & touring, and display photos, audio & video clips.
4. A booking agent for corporate events wants to see that the band are currently performing live and have a way to contact them for potential bookings.
5. Music Publishers and Project Supervisors might be looking for a song for a movie or TV programme and would like to hear samples of music.

Working with "mobile-first" in mind, I decided to go with the format discribed in the "Resume Lesson" where the logo is on top, followed by a picture of the band, followed by a colourful menu for four pages. 
I used the colours from the cover of the band's "Best Of" album, red, yellow, green and pink along with a funky font for the headings to create an authentic 60's display.
I split the Home Page into two sections: Latest Release section to display the bands most up to date musical release and the Latest News section for the user to see the latest news headings about the band.
In the footer, I put a list of upcoming tour dates, a newsletter for the user to sign up to, and social media links. 
The Music Page shows album covers and provides a way for the user to listen to the band's music. Again, header and footer are the same.
The Band Page has a picture of each band member along with an image of the instrument they played in the band, followed by a brief bio on each member. Again, header and footer are the same.
The Book Us Page plays a video of the band and displays a booking form for the user to enter their details and enquire about potential dates. Again, header and footer are the same.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Menu Items: If the user clicks on any of the menu items they will be taken to that page.
- Read More Buttons: By clicking on these, the user is brought to a new page to read all about the corresponding news heading.
- Newsletter Sign Up: In the footer, I put an input box for the user to put their email address and a submit button to sign up to the bands newsletter.
- Social Media Icons: Once clicked, the user will be brought to the associated Social Media Page.
- Audio Display: On the "Home" page and the "Music" page, under the pictures of the band are "Click to listen" buttons where the user can listen to music. A new page will open playing the song on an audio player.
- Video Display: On arriving at the "Book Us" page, a video of the band playing "Daydream Believer" plays. A pause button is displayed on the video for the user to pause the music any time.
- Booking Form: In the "Book Us" page, the user can leave a booking enquiry for the band along with their name and email address.

### Features Left to Implement
- more live videos.
- more audio links.
- add a store for merchandise.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com): For the Grid System, Responsive actions and buttons across the site.
- Hover(ianlunn.github.io/Hover/): I used "sweep to bottom" hover on the menu items.  When the user hovers over a menu item, a transparent shade sweeps down over the selection to highlight what the user is about to select.  Also used on Social Media icons in the Footer.
- Google Fonts: I used "Spicy Rice" font on the menu headings and page headings to create a fun 60's vibe.  I used "Exo" font (with sans-serif backup) on everything else for easy reading.
- Font Awesome(fontawesome.com): For Social Media icons in the footer.

## Testing
- Page Navigation: Page menu across all pages.  The Monkees logo on top also brings the user to the Home page.
- Social Media icons: Clicking on each will bring the user to the associated Social Media Pages.
- Audio Clips: When "Click to listen" button is clicked, a new page opens with audio player playing the music clip. (used target="_blank")
- Video Clips: Used an iframe for this.  The video starts playing when page is accessed.  Can pause it by clicking on the video screen.
- Booking Form: On "Book Us" page and has input boxes for name, email and enquiry text.
